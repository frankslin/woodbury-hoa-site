### Home Painting Policy
Per Article V of the community CC&R’s, the Woodbury Homeowners Association and the ACC is required to maintain our unique neighborhood appearance and keep it within community character. 

The Woodbury ACC has adopted the following rules regarding repainting of homes:

1. If any homeowner wishes to repaint their home with its existing colors, they must submit the Request to Paint Home form to the ACC. Keeping current home color is the ACC’s preference.

2. If any homeowner wishes to repaint their home a different color, in whole or part, they must choose from colors already in use in the neighborhood -or- from a list of currently allowed color schemes provided by the ACC. The homeowner must submit a Request to Paint Home form to the ACC for approval. The chosen paint scheme cannot already be in use on any homes located within a 3-home radius (including the opposite side of the street) of the home requesting the change. Choosing from colors already in use and/or from the ACC provided list does not guarantee approval.

3. If any homeowner wishes to repaint their home with colors that are different than the currently allowed colors, they must consult with the ACC’s recommended professional color consultant, or a professional color consultant of their choice, at the homeowners’ expense. The consultant’s recommendations must be submitted, along with their credentials or business card and a Request to Paint Home form to the ACC for approval. Using a professional color consultant does not guarantee ACC approval.

The ACC has up to 30 days to render a decision. The Request to Paint Home form can be found on the HOA website, Facebook page or requested by emailing the Board at [woodburyhoa@hotmail.com](mailto:woodburyhoa@hotmail.com).
