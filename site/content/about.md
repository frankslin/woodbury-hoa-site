Welcome to the neighborhood! The Woodbury HOA includes all homes in the Woodbury residential neighborhood on 134th Ave NE, 134th Ct. NE and NE 199th Place. Additionally, it includes five homes from the Stratford neighborhood off of NE 200th St., that back up to the Native Growth Protection Easement (NPGE), "the woods" and share partial ownership of the NPGE along with Woodbury neighborhood.

This site was designed, built, and produced right here in the Woodbury neighborhood. The photo backdrops were also taken in our neighborhood. If you’ve taken a photo in the neighborhood you’d like to be featured on the site as a background, send it to woodburyhoa@hotmail.com.
