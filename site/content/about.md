Welcome to the neighborhood!

The Woodbury Homeowner's Association (HOA) includes all homes in the Woodbury residential neighborhood on **134th Avenue NE**, **134th Court NE** and **NE 199th Place**. Additionally, it includes six homes from the Stratford neighborhood off of **NE 200th Street** that back up to the Native Growth Protection Easement (NPGE), "the woods", and share partial ownership of the NPGE along with Woodbury neighborhood.

We would like to share a bit about the Woodbury HOA board with you.  It is the responsibility of the HOA board to oversee the maintenance of the common areas, establish and collect dues, adopt and publish community rules and regulations, keep a record of board acts and financials, and other such duties as laid out in the community governing documents, so as to maintain the integrity and property values of the homeowners within the association. Please let us know if you have not yet received a copy of the HOA governing documents (CC&Rs, Bylaws, Articles of Incorporation, etc), and we will email you a copy of those. 

This site was designed, built, and produced right here in the Woodbury neighborhood. The photo backdrops were also taken in our neighborhood. If you've taken a photo in the neighborhood you'd like to be featured on the site as a background, send it to [woodburyhoa@hotmail.com](mailto:woodburyhoa@hotmail.com).
