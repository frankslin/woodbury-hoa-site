HOA Dues are paid yearly and are always due June 1. HOA dues are $300. Late dues are assessed a $50 fine for every month it is late. Your dues cover many things, including the following: electricity for street lights, landscaping for common areas, snow plow services, insurance for common areas, property taxes, annual meeting and administrative supplies, and emergency funds for maintenance and repairs to common areas. Checks can be made out to Woodbury HOA and mailed to:
