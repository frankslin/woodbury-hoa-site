## The Natural Growth Protection Easement (NGPE) in Our Community

Welcome to the heart of our neighborhood -- a place where nature thrives! Our community is proud to host a dedicated **Natural Growth Protection Easement** (NGPE) at its center, preserving the beauty and ecological balance of our local environment. This protected area ensures that native plants and wildlife can flourish undisturbed, providing a natural buffer that enhances the tranquility and charm of our surroundings. As stewards of this space, we are committed to maintaining its integrity for future generations to enjoy.

The NGPE represents our shared commitment to sustainability and responsible land use, helping to safeguard water quality, reduce erosion, and support local wildlife habitats. While the NGPE offers scenic beauty and a peaceful backdrop for our homes, it also comes with certain restrictions to ensure its continued preservation. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation in respecting the guidelines that protect this vital natural area.

## Rotary Community Park (Woodinville)

Nestled near our community, **Rotary Community Park** offers a vibrant and welcoming space for residents and visitors alike.
