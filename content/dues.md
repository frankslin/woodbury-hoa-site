There's an additional $150/year for homes on **134<sup>th</sup> Ct NE** and **NE 199<sup>th</sup> Pl**, for private road maintenance. Late dues are assessed a $50 fine for every month it is late. Your dues cover many things, including the following: electricity for street lights, landscaping for common areas, snow plow services, insurance for common areas, property taxes for common areas, annual meeting and administrative supplies, and emergency funds for maintenance and repairs to common areas.
