We would like to share a bit about the Woodbury HOA board with you.  It is the responsibility of the HOA board to oversee the maintenance of the common areas, establish and collect dues, adopt and publish community rules and regulations, keep a record of board acts and financials, and other such duties as laid out in the [HOA governing documents]({{< relref "documents.md" >}}), so as to maintain the integrity and property values of the homeowners within the association.

This site was designed, built, and produced right here in the Woodbury neighborhood. The photo backdrops were also taken in our neighborhood. If you've taken a photo in the neighborhood you'd like to be featured on the site as a background, send it to [webmaster@woodbury-hoa.com](mailto:webmaster@woodbury-hoa.com).
